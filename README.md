# Dart Null Safety and Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient handling of null values and exceptions. The `bug.dart` file contains code that showcases this error.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version of the code that handles the null and exception cases correctly.

The code involves a class with a private integer variable, a getter to access its value (handling potential nulls), and a setter that throws an exception if a negative value is attempted to be assigned.

This example is useful for illustrating best practices for null safety and exception handling in Dart applications.
